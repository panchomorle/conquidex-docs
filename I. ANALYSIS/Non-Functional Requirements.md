### **Non-Functional Requirements**

### **Performance**

1. The system must handle concurrent users efficiently, supporting at least 100 simultaneous users without performance degradation.
2. Events and attendance data must load in under 2 seconds for typical queries.

### **Scalability**

1. The system should scale horizontally to accommodate additional users as the organization grows.
2. The architecture must support additional roles or features without requiring significant changes.

### **Usability**

### **Security**

1. Implement strong authentication mechanisms, including password encryption and secure storage.
2. Ensure role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access to data or functionality.
3. Validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other attacks.

### **Data Integrity**

1. Validate relationships between classes, units, and members to ensure that:
    - Pathfinders cannot belong to multiple units.
    - Overlapping events with the same name and location are not allowed.
2. Ensure accurate and consistent recording of achievements and attendance.

### **Reliability and Availability**

1. The system must have 99.9% uptime, ensuring continuous availability.
2. Automatic backups should be scheduled daily to prevent data loss.

### **Maintainability**

1. The codebase must be modular and adhere to clean coding practices, enabling easier updates and debugging.
2. Comprehensive documentation must be provided for developers and administrators.

### **Compliance**

1. The system must comply with applicable data protection regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, ensuring member data privacy and security.
